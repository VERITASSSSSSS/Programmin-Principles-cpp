# Drills

1.  Write a program that consists of a  `while`-loop that (each time around the loop) reads in two  `int`s and then prints them. Exit the program when a terminating  `'|'`  is entered.

	```cpp
	#include <iostream>
	#include <vector>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		int i, j;
		while (cin >> i >> j)
		{
			cout <<"Value I is: " << i << '\t' <<"Value j is:" << j;
		}
		return 0;
	}
	```
	The input and output of this program is :

	```cpp
	1 4
	Value I is: 1   Value j is:4
	3 5
	Value I is: 3   Value j is:5
	3 5
	Value I is: 3   Value j is:5
	```
	
2.  Change the program to write out  `the  smaller  value  is:`  followed by the smaller of the numbers and  `the  larger  value  is:`  followed by the larger value.

	```cpp
	
	```
	The input and output of this program is :

	```cpp

	```
	3.   Augment the program so that it writes the line  `the  numbers  are  equal`  (only) if they are equal.

	```cpp
	
	```
	The input and output of this program is :

	```cpp
	
	```
